# HiHAT
Retargetable infrastructure for Hierarchical Heterogeneous Asynchronous Tasking (HiHAT)
This is a community-wide, collaborative, open-sourced project aimed at 
  - Exposing and enabling innovative features in hardware platforms
  - Fostering a common software architecture that spans multiple target platforms
  - Providing a way to plug in robust and performant target-specific implementations
  - Enabling tasking and language runtimes to productively share infrastructure
